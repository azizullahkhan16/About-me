# About-me
I love programming. It is not very long since I started programming but it has intrigued me a lot. I am a part-time Application developer and just published my first ever application in Google play store. 

I love to play and watch cricket and I often enjoy it in my leisure time. It is a very technical and strategical game
that's why it has caught my interest for years.

In future, I want to explore the field of Artificial intelligence and Machine learning because these fields have emerged the most in past few years and the upcoming era is all about them.
